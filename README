Description
-----------
The ParallelPort library can be used to access the registers and pins of your
parallel port. This is all done with user space ioctl calls. A test program is
available with which you can toggle and read all the pins of your parallel port.
You must have the OpenGL an GLUT (or compatible) libraries to compile the test
program.
